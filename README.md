# CS330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning (Stanford Fall 2019)

Update Feb 06 2021: This project is out-dated and the solution on A1 (pytorch) is wrong

  - New assignments from 2020 class has updated to Tensorflow 2.x
  - Assignment 1 (pytorch) has some problems on `MANN`, it's wrong, much different
  from the original. I'll fix it on next week (~Feb 10-12)
